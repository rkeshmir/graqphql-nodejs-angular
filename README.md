# graqphql-nodejs-angular
This a hello world project to run a graphql server with nodejs and connect to it with Angular. The code comes in two parts: Server and client. We use [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-yoga) to run a nodejs server which supports graphql requests. For the client side we create an Angular project and use [apollo-client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client#readme) to connect to the server.

In the following we explain:
1. The example problem to solve
2. Server side code
3. Clien side code

## The example problem to solve
For the simplest example that we can cover our content with I assumed a list of events which have a name, a location, and number of attendant. We like to see a list of all events with their live number attendants. Number of attendants should update automatically without refreshing the page.


## Server side code


## Clien side code
